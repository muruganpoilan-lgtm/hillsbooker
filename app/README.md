# Hill Booker app (Flutter)

The guest app for Hill Booker: search, property page with photos and rooms, reserve with the 10-minute hold,
and My bookings. It talks to the same backend as the website, so the backend in `../roomly/backend` must be running.

## One-time setup (Windows PowerShell)

1. Install Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install (Flutter 3.24 or newer) and run `flutter doctor`.
2. Make a project shell, then copy this app's files over it:
   ```powershell
   flutter create roomly_app
   Copy-Item -Recurse -Force .\lib\* .\roomly_app\lib\
   Copy-Item -Force .\pubspec.yaml .\roomly_app\pubspec.yaml
   cd roomly_app
   flutter pub get
   ```
   (Run the first three lines from the folder that holds this README.)
3. Allow plain-http connections to your computer while developing. In
   `roomly_app\android\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml`, change the `<application` line to
   `<application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` and add, just above `<application`:
   `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>`

## Run it
Start the backend first (`uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0`), then:
```powershell
flutter run                                              # Android emulator (uses http://10.0.2.2:8000)
flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE=http://192.168.1.5:8000   # real phone: your computer's Wi-Fi address
```
`--host 0.0.0.0` lets a real phone reach the backend. Allow Python through Windows Firewall if asked.

## What is in it
- Home: search slip (city, dates, guests) and the hills-to-sea city list
- Results: type chips, sort by price or rating
- Property: photo pager, amenities, rooms, change dates, Reserve (asks for login first)
- Bookings: 10-minute hold countdown, test confirm, release, cancel
- Account: log in, sign up, log out

Paying: when the backend has Razorpay keys, a held booking shows **Pay ₹...** and opens Razorpay's payment sheet
(uses the `razorpay_flutter` package, which `flutter pub get` fetches). Without keys it shows the test confirm button.
Refunds on cancellation follow the rule in the website README.

## Owner and admin tools (Manage tab)
Sign up with **I want to list my property** ticked (or log in as an owner or admin) and a fourth tab, **Manage**, appears:
- Add a property: name, type, city, address, description, amenities
- Add photos from the phone gallery to the property and to each room (first photo is the cover)
- Add rooms with price, number of rooms and guests; open dates for booking and set a special price
- See the next 60 nights and every booking on your properties
- Admins also see **Waiting for your approval** and can Approve or Reject new places

New properties are hidden from guests until an admin approves them.

Photo picking: Android needs nothing extra. On iOS add this to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
`NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` = "Choose photos of your property".
